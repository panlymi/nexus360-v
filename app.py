st.markdown("""
1. **Problem Definition**:
   - Identify the decision alternatives and the criteria on which they will be evaluated.
   - Alternatives could be different entities, such as companies or projects, and criteria could be factors like cost, performance, etc.

2. **Construct the Decision Matrix**:
   - Create a decision matrix where rows represent alternatives, and columns represent criteria. Each cell in the matrix represents how an alternative performs on a given criterion.

3. **Normalize the Decision Matrix**:
   - Normalize each criterion to make sure all criteria contribute equally, regardless of their units of measurement. 
     - **For Benefit Criteria**: Normalize by dividing each value by the Euclidean norm.
     - **For Cost Criteria**: Normalize by dividing the Euclidean norm by each value.

4. **Apply Weights**:
   - Assign weights to the criteria based on their importance. Multiply each normalized value by its corresponding weight to get the weighted normalized matrix.

5. **Calculate the MOORA Score**:
   - The MOORA Score for each alternative is calculated as the sum of the weighted normalized values across all criteria. Higher MOORA Scores indicate better-performing alternatives.

6. **Rank the Alternatives**:
   - Rank the alternatives based on their MOORA Scores. The alternative with the highest score is considered the best.

7. **Sensitivity Analysis** (Optional):
   - Perform sensitivity analysis to see how changes in criteria weights or values affect the rankings. This can help assess the stability and reliability of the rankings.
